# instagram-clone

Clone of Instagram created using React and Google's Firebase. Project to practice using React framework, React Router and Firebase for authentication and storage. Users can create account using Firebase email authentication and upload images. Images are stored using Firebase Storage and displayed in React component with working like and comment system.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Firebase

Began by creating skeleton pages in React for login, sign-up, forgot password and homepage. Then, integrated Firebase into React project. First with ability to sign-up and login with email/password, then with the ability to post images with likes and comments saved in Firebase. This was the most challenging part of the project, particularly getting the comments on the images to save and display correctly. Finally, once the logic was working I used CSS to match Instagram's layout and color-scheme. 

## Lessons Learned:

First project using Firebase and integrating authentication/storage into a React project. Definitely a challenge, but was extremely rewarding after getting Firebase working correctly. Also useful practice learning and implementing .env files into a project to hide the Firebase API info.
